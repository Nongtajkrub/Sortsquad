> Trash Game is a fast-paced multiplayer game where you play as a trash bin and catch matching falling trash.

In this fast-paced 2D pixel multiplayer game, YOU become a living, rolling trash bin! Choose your bin type — General, Recycle, Battery, or Dangerous Waste — and race to catch the falling trash from the sky. But watch out! You can only collect the items that match your bin. Grab the wrong junk, and you're in trouble! With colorful pixel graphics, chaotic trash storms, and educational fun, Trash Game turns saving the planet into a wild, competitive adventure.
Think fast. Sort smart. Rule the bins.

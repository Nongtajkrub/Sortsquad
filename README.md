A local multiplayer game that promotes correctly sorting trash in celebration of Environmental Day. The desktop version is built with Pygame, while the web version is build in TypeScript using Phaser. The game was originally developed in just 7 days—you can check out that version on the [7days branch](https://github.com/Nongtajkrub/Sortsquad/tree/7days). Initially created as a showcase for an event hosted by the Phuket Provincial Administrative Organization (องค์การบริหารส่วนจังหวัดภูเก็ต), the game has since been refined and enhanced, including a full rewrite for web support, to allow it to be presented at additional events.
